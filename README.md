# What is this ?

Folder contains questions that you can solve using **any** programming language (in our case its **javascript**).

All questions can be solved without knowing any specific methods/functions of javascript.

Almost in all cases knowledge of `loops, functions (callback), if statements, switch cases, data types (arrays, objects, string, numbers etc.), toString, parseInt ...` will be enough.

# Time Assumptions

- ~ 20 questions total

- If **10 min** per question \* 20 questions = 200 min total
- 200 min / 60 = ~ 3.3 hours of work without rest

---

- If **15 min** per question \* 20 questions = 300 min total
- 300 min / 60 = 5 hours of work without rest

---

- If **20 min** per question \* 20 questions = 400 min total
- 400 min / 60 = ~ 6.6 hours of work without rest
